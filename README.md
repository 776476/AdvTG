# AdvTG: An Adversarial Traffic Generation Framework to Deceive DL-Based Malicious Traffic Detection Models

This repository contains the source code and resources for **AdvTG**, an adversarial traffic generation framework designed to deceive deep learning-based malicious traffic detection systems.

## Overview

![AdvTG Overview](./overview.png)

The pipeline consists of three main components:
1. **Detection Model Training**: Extracts both token-level and image-based features from HTTP traffic to train robust detection models.
2. **LLM Finetuning**: Uses instruction-style prompts to guide a large language model to generate benign or malicious traffic samples.
3. **RL-based Adversarial Generation**: Uses PPO to fine-tune the LLM in a black-box setting against a fixed DL-based traffic detector.
